There are no premium features and no adverts - this is 100% complete and free! See the "Other Notes" tab for how to get started as well as the more advanced features. How easy is it to use? The fine people at [Webucator](https://www.webucator.com "Webucator") have put together an excellent video showing you how to get started with it..

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc7cvpQS-xQ

== Getting Started ==

To add a video to a post or page simply use the shortcode `[youtube]video[/youtube]`, where `video` is the ID or URL of the video. Alternatively, you can add one (or more) widgets to your sidebar.

Within the administration area of your blog you will find a new menu named `YouTube` (see screenshot 1). Click on the `Options` sub-menu to set a number of general options. Alternatively click on the `Profiles` sub-menu to set the default options which define the output of your videos - any videos you display (unless overridden by parameters - more on that later) will use the settings from the Profiles screen.

Although this document contains a lot of information more is available from a series of linked pages, plus as much information as possible is provided on the various administration pages. Whilst on the administration pages, click on the "Help" button in the top right for some useful tips and links. If anything isn't covered and you're unsure of what it does please ask [on the forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/youtube-embed "WordPress Plugins Forum").

== Advanced embedding options ==

A basic shortcode will embed your video using your default profile settings. However, you may wish to override some of these options on a video-by-video basis - this is done via parameters added to the shortcode.

e.g. `[youtube width=300 height=200]Z_sCoHGIpU0[/youtube]`

Which options are available depends upon the embedding type you're using as well as the viewers set-up (for example, whether they have Flash installed or not). You can specify any of the parameters but they may be ignored. Please see the Profile screen in Administration for details of which parameters are supported by which embed method.

* **annotation** - yes or no, this determines if annotations are shown
* **autohide** - 0, 1 or 2, this parameter indicates whether the video controls will automatically hide after a video begins playing. The default behaviour, a value of 2, is for the video progress bar to fade out while the player controls (play button, volume control, etc.) remain visible. If this parameter is set to 0, the video progress bar and the video player controls will be visible throughout the video. If this parameter is set to 1, then the video progress bar and the player controls will slide out of view a couple of seconds after the video starts playing. They will only reappear if the user moves her mouse over the video player or presses a key on her keyboard.
* **autoplay** - yes or no, should the video automatically start playing?
* **cc** - yes or no, decided whether closed captions (subtitles) are displayed
* **color** - white or red, the colour of the progress bar (see the FAQ about having a white progress bar with the light theme)
* **controls** - 0, 1 or 2, this decides whether the controls should display and when the Flash will load. A value of 0 will not show the controls but 1 or 2 will. A value of 2 will load Flash once the user initiates playback - otherwise it's loaded straight away.
* **disablekb** - yes or no, disable keyboard controls
* **dynamic** - whether to use dynamic sizing or not. When switched on the video will resize when your site does (i.e. responsive). If a video width is supplied this will be the maximum width, otherwise full width will be assumed. Height is ignored and will be worked out automatically.
* **fullscreen** - yes or no, this will add the fullscreen button to the toolbar. This also works with EmbedPlus.
* **height** - the video height, in pixels
* **https** - yes or no, whether to use HTTPS for the video
* **info** - yes or no, show video information. If displaying a playlist this will show video thumbnails
* **list** - if you've specified your own list, use this to select the way the videos should be output. Should be `random` (display videos in a random order), `single` (show just one video, randomly picked from the list) or `order` (show each video in the original order - this is the default)
* **loop** - yes or no, whether to start the video again once it ends
* **modest** - reduce the branding on the video
* **profile** - specify a different default profile (see section on Profiles for further details)
* **ratio** - allows you to define a window ratio - specify just a height or width and the ratio will calculate the missing dimension. Uses the format x:x, e.g. 4:3, 16:9
* **related** - yes or no, show related videos
* **search** - yes or no, create a playlist based on a search word. The search word should be specified instead of a video ID. See "Automatically Generate Playlists" option for more details
* **ssl** - Use SSL or not? Basically, if set on the URL will be HTTPS rather than HTTP.
* **start** - a number of seconds from where to start the video playing
* **stop** - this stops the video at a specific time, given in seconds
* **style** - apply CSS elements directly to the video output
* **template** - specify a template (see section on Templates for further details)
* **theme** - dark or light, display player controls (like a 'play' button or volume control) within a dark or light control bar
* **user** - yes or no, create a playlist based on a user's uploads. The search word should be specified instead of a video ID. See "Automatically Generate Playlists" option for more details
* **width** - the video width, in pixels

== Alternative Shortcodes ==

Within administration, selecting `Options` from the `YouTube` menu will provide a list of general options. One option is named `Alternative Shortcode` and allows you to specify another shortcode that will work exactly the same as the standard shortcode of `[youtube]`.

There are 2 reasons why you might want to do this...

1. If migrating from another plugin, it may use a different shortcode - more details can be found in the section named "Migration"
2. If another plugin uses the same shortcode (e.g. Jetpack) this will allow you to specify and use an alternative

The new shortcode can also have its own default profile assigned to it (see the Profiles section for more details on this).

== Widgets ==

Widgets can be easily added. In Administration simply click on the `Widgets` option under the `Appearance` menu. `YouTube Embed` will be one of the listed widgets. Drag it to the appropriate sidebar on the right hand side and then choose your video options - any that aren't specified are taken from your supplied profile.

If you wish to display an automatically generated playlist based on user name or search term, simply change the "ID Type" appropriately and then specify the name or search word(s) where the video ID would normally be entered.

And that's it! You can use unlimited widgets, so you can add different videos to different sidebars.

== Playlists ==

YouTube allows users to create their own playlists - collections of videos that can be played in sequence.

YouTube used to supply Playlist IDs as 16 digits and these can still be used...

e.g. `[youtube]095393D5B42B2266[/youtube]`

Alternatively, if you're using a newer, non-16 digit ID then append 'PL' to the beginning.

e.g. `[youtube]PLVTLbc6i-h_iuhdwUfuPDLFLXG2QQnz-x[/youtube]`

Playlists cannot be used along with the EmbedPlus embedding method.

A better alternative to playlists is the build-in lists function in YouTube Embed - see the Lists section for further details.

== Templates ==

Both in the profile and as a parameter you can specify a template. This allows you to define any CSS that you wish to "wrap" around the YouTube output.

The template consists simply of any HTML that you wish but with `%video%` where you wish the video to appear.

e.g. `<div align="center">%video%</div>`

Be wary that when adding template via a parameter that any HTML included may cause your video to have `<pre>` tags wrapped around it. The easiest way to check and fix this is to view any post in the HTML editor and remove any PRE tags that have been added.

== Profiles ==

You've probably already had a look at the default profile, accessible by selecting `Profiles` from the `YouTube` administration menu option. Here you can specify the default option which will apply to any embedded video.

However, in the top right hand corner is a drop-down box and a button marked `Change profile`. Simply select an alternative profile and click the button and you can then edit the options for this alternative profile. You can even name it as well.

To use this profile, simply use the parameter `profile=` followed by the profile name or number. The options for this profile will then be used.

This could be useful, for instance, for having a separate profile for different parts of your site - posts, sidebar, etc - or for different video types (e.g. widescreen).

By default you have 5 extra profiles - if you wish to have more (or less) this number can be changed from the `Options` sub-menu.

== Lists ==

Although this plugin will play standard YouTube playlists their playback options are limited. Instead you can create your own video lists. Under the `YouTube` administration menu is a sub-menu named `Lists`. Select this and you will be shown a screen where you can type in a list of video IDs (or URLS). You can also provide a name for the list.

When saving the list each video is validated.

As with profiles you can select the list from a drop down in the top right-hand corner. You can also change the number of lists from the `Options` sub-menu too.

To use a list, simply specify the list name or number instead of a video ID.

e.g. `[youtube]List 1[/youtube]`

There is also a parameter, named `list`, that lets you modify the playback of the list. You can either play each in turn, play them randomly, or have just one played (but picked randomly).

== Automatically Generated Playlists ==

YouTube now includes options to automatically generate playlists based upon a user name or a search name.

To use, simply use the `user` or `search` parameter to switch the appropriate option on. Then, instead of a video ID or URL, you should specify either the user name or search word(s).

== Thumbnails ==

YouTube embed also has the ability to return a thumbnail of a video (sorry, this doesn't work with playlists). There are two methods you can use for this - a shortcode or a function call.

Use the function call `youtube_thumb_embed( 'id', 'paras', '', 'alt', 'nolink' )` to add a thumbnail to any part of your theme.

Like the video embed equivalent, the `id` is the video ID and `alt` is the alternative text for the thumbnail image (optional). `nolink`, if set to `true`, will output the thumbnail without a link to the YouTube video, allowing you to add your own.

The parameters are different, however, but, again, are separated by ampersand.

The parameters are as follows...

* **rel** - specify a REL override, e.g. rel="nofollow"
* **target** - specify a TARGET override, e.g. target="_blank"
* **width** - this specifies the width of the thumbnail image
* **height** - this specifies the height of the thumbnail image
* **version** - which version of the thumbnail to use. This can be `default`, `hq` (for a high quality version of the default image), `start`, `middle` or `end`. The latter 3 indicate where from the video the thumbnails are taken from

e.g. `youtube_thumb_embed( 'id', 'rel=nofollow&target=_blank', '', 'Demo Video' )`

To use the shortcode method, insert `[youtube_thumb]id[/youtube_thumb]` into a post or page to create a thumbnail of the relevant video ID which, once clicked, will open up the appropriate YouTube page.

Like the function call above, you can specify a number of parameters. They are the same as detailed above but with the addition of one further parameter...

* **alt** - specify some `ALT` text for the thumbnail image

e.g. `[youtube_thumb target="_blank" alt="Demo video"]id[/youtube_thumb]`

This overrides the `TARGET` and `ALT` elements of the thumbnail.

You can also use `nolink` as a parameter with the shortcode, which works in the same way as with the function call.

== Shortened URL ==

You may return a short URL for any YouTube video by way of either a function call or a shortcode.

For a function call add `youtube_short_url( 'id' )` to your code to return a URL (note that this is not written out, but returned as a value), where `id` is the video ID.

e.g. `<a href="<?php echo youtube_short_url( 'Z_sCoHGIpU0' ); ?>"Click here for video</a>`

This will create a link to a video using the short URL standard.

To use the shortcode method simply insert `[youtube_url id=xx]` anywhere within a post to return a shortened URL. `xx` is the ID of the video.

== Downloading Videos ==

If you wish your users to be able to download a YouTube video or playlist then you can do this automatically or manually via either a shortcode of PHP function call.

In the Profiles screen within administration there is an option to automatically show a download link. You can specify some text or HTML to display as well as CSS.

If you'd prefer to do this manually then the function call is named `get_video_download` and has one parameter - the video ID. It will return the download link URL.

e.g. `<a href="<?php echo get_video_download( 'Z_sCoHGIpU0' ); ?>">Download the video</a>`

Alternatively, you can use the shortcode `download_video`. The content to link is specified between the open and close shortcode tags and there are 3 parameters...

* **id** - The ID of the video or playlist. This is required.
* **target** - The target of the link (e.g. `_blank`). This is optional.
* **nofollow** - yes or no, use this to specify whether a `nofollow` tag should be added to the link. This is optional and by default it will be included.

e.g. `[download_video id="Z_sCoHGIpU0" target="_blank"]Download the video[/download_video]`

== Caching ==

Caches are used to improve plugin performance.

Under the `YouTube` administration menu is a sub-menu named `Options`. Select this and find the section named `Performance`, under which is the 'Embed Cache' option. This is how long to store the resulting cache code. It will update if you change any parameters so, theoretically, shouldn't need to change. It defaults to 24 hours. In all cases putting the cache to 0 will switch off caching for that option.

== Further Embedding Options ==

Under the `YouTube` administration menu is a sub-menu named `Options`. Select this and find the section named `Embedding`. There are 2 options here...

1. Add Metadata - by default, RDFa metadata is added to video output. This can be switched on or off as required (see the FAQs for more information about metadata usage).
2. Feed - videos will not appear in feeds so use this option to decide whether you want them to be converted to links and/or thumbnails.

== Installation ==

YouTube Embed can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration. Alternatively, it can be downloaded and installed manually...

1. Upload the entire `youtube-embed` folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Now you can add the shortcode to your posts and pages!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've upgraded to version 4.0+ from an earlier version and I was using the widget feature to display videos =

I previously allowed some, although not all, parameters to be specified within the widget. However, as you can simply create your own profile for widgets I have removed this and, without leaving lots of redundant code behind, it was difficult to keep this backwards compatible.

Therefore, if you're upgrading you may find your widgets don't now display correctly. The best thing to do, beforehand if you can, is to create a profile just for the widgets and assign that to each. You'll probably find the video size is the bit most likely to cause issues. Apologies for this.

= How do I find the ID of a YouTube video? =

If you play a YouTube video, look at the URL - it will probably look something like this - `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y4qzc_JTg`.

The video ID is the list of letters and numbers after `v=`, in this case `L5Y4qzc_JTg`.

= The video output is overlapping or stuttering =

If you go into the Profile screen in Administration there is a "Window Mode" option. This defines how Flash output interacts with any other around it. "Window" is the default and gives good performance but may cause overlapping. If overlapping is causing an issue try "Opaque".

= No video is showing =

If you find no video is showing but there's no error either check the source code of the page. Can you find the text "<!--YouTube Error: bad URL entered-->" in the page? If so, you have Jetpack installed and that is displaying the video instead.

There are two ways around this.

First, you could disable all the shortcodes in Jetpack - Jetpack allows you to deactivate certain "modules" of the plugin and, if you can live without the other extra shortcodes, deactivating the shortcodes part will restore functionality back to YouTube Embed

Alternatively, you can use a secondary shortcode - [youtube_video]. Use this instead of [youtube] and YouTube Embed will render the results without a problem

This second suggestion will work for any plugin that may use the same shortcode.

= My OPTIONS table seems to be full of cache entries for YouTube Embed =

Due to a housekeeping limitation in WordPress cache entries, which are stored in the OPTIONS table, may get left behind. There are 2 solutions to clearing this.

First of all, in the Options menu in YouTube Embed administration, there is an option in the performance section named "Clear Cache". Simply tick this box and click on the "Save Settings" button to clear out any cache.

However, the best option is to install the plugin [Transient Cleaner](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/artiss-transient-cleaner/ "Transient Cleaner"), which will housekeep the OPTIONS table automatically.

= Is this plugin compatible with Turn Off The Lights? =

Yes, it works beautifully with [Turn Off The Lights](https://www.turnoffthelights.com/ "Turn Off The Lights"), thanks to the very kind Develop

= The "autostart" feature is not working in iOS =

Unfortunately, this is a restriction that has been put in place by Apple.

= I can't get the video to play at a specific resolution by default =

There is no way to specify this - YouTube makes the decision on which version to play depending on a number of factors.

= There are black borders on top/underneath my video =

This is usually due to using a different ratio than the video was designed for. If you're not sure which ratio to use head to its page on YouTube, click on Share and then Embed and then Show More. A video size will be shown, which you can use to work out the correct ration for the video.

= The controls under the video don't display properly when using Firefox =

This is a bug in Firefox. Short term, switch on SSL in the Profiles screen and it will work. Longer term, I've [raised a bug report with Mozilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1223515 "Bug 1223515 - Broken images in YouTube embedded player when not using SSL").

= I have another issue or a request =

Before reporting it please bear in mind that this plugin uses the standard YouTube API. Adding extra functionality to the player itself is not possible and there are [known issues](https://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/list?q=label:API-YouTube "YouTube API Known Issues") with it. I would also recommend performing a Google search for your issue too first, as this will often resolve a lot of queries.

== Changelog ==

= 4.0.2 =
* Maintenance: Not really a bug, but in some circumstances I wasn't initialising a variable used when generating the embed code. It worked fine but wasn't best practise so fixed. Sloppy.
* Maintenance: Modified the default parameters so new user videos should appear with the same options as on YouTube itself. Consistent.
* Maintenance: I ABSOLUTELY refuse to call this a bug. But I was calling get_the_excerpt() to build some of the video meta data. For some reason, still unknown to me, other plugins were crashing as a result of it. I've removed it for now but am investigating the cause. Frustrating.
* Enhancement: WMODE is now only added to the embed URL if it's anything other than the default. Shrinkage.

= 4.0.1 =
* Maintenance: Left some debug code in by mistake. Doh. Sometimes I'd forget my own head if it wasn't screwed on.... Apologies to those affected.
