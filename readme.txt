A simple to use method of embedding YouTube videos into your posts and pages but with powerful features for those that need them.

== Description ==

Artiss YouTube Embed (formally YouTube Embed) is an incredibly simple, yet powerful, method of embedding YouTube videos into your WordPress site. Options include:

* XHTML and HTML5 compliant - works with all the latest browsers
* Multiple embedding methods available - OBJECT, IFRAME and EmbedPlus
* Allow users to add videos to comments
* Build your own playlists and play them back however you want
* Create multiple profiles - use them for different videos to get the exact style that you want
* Google compatible metadata is added to the video output - great for SEO!
* Code is cached for maximum performance
* Using a different YouTube plugin? Documentation and tools are provided to help you migrate to Artiss YouTube Embed
* And much, much more!

To add a video to a post or page simply use the shortcode `[youtube]video[/youtube]`, where `video` is the ID or URL of the video. Alternatively, you can add one (or more) widgets to your sidebar.

Within the administration area of your blog you will find a new menu named `YouTube` (see screenshot 1). Click on the `Options` sub-menu to set a number of general options. Alternatively click on the `Profiles` sub-menu to set the default options which define the output of your videos - any videos you display (unless overridden by parameters - more on that later) will use the settings from the Profiles screen.

The above should get you started - for more information and advanced options please read the "Other Notes" tab. This also includes details on how to migrate from another embedding plugin to Artiss YouTube Embed.

Although this document contains a lot of information more is available from a series of linked pages, plus as much information as possible is provided on the various administration pages. Whilst on the administration pages, click on the "Help" button in the top right for some useful tips and links. If anything isn't covered and you're unsure of what it does please ask [on the forum](http://www.artiss.co.uk/forum "WordPress Plugins Forum").

== Advanced embedding options ==

A basic shortcode will embed your video using your default profile settings. However, you may wish to override some of these options on a video-by-video basis - this is done via parameters added to the shortcode.

e.g. `[youtube width=300 height=200]Z_sCoHGIpU0[/youtube]`

Which options are available depends upon the embedding type you're using - you can specify any of them but, depending on the type, they may be ignored. There are 3 types - OBJECT, IFRAME and EmbedPlus. IFRAME is the current YouTube default and will use HTML 5, if available - this makes it ideal for maximum compatibility. However, HTML5 has a number of features that's not available with the standard Flash player.

The following parameters work with all embed types:

* **audio** - yes or no, this will hide the video and display just the toolbar (ideal for audio only playback) if switched on
* **autoplay** - yes or no, should the video automatically start playing?
* **height** - the video height, in pixels
* **list** - if you've specified your own list, use this to select the way the videos should be output. Should be `random` (display videos in a random order), `single` (show just one video, randomly picked from the list) or `order` (show each video in the original order - this is the default)
* **profile** - specify a different default profile (see section on Profiles for further details)
* **ratio** - allows you to define a window ratio - specify just a height or width and the ratio will calculate the missing dimension. Uses the format x:x, e.g. 4:3, 16:9
* **start** - a number of seconds from where to start the video playing
* **style** - apply CSS elements directly to the video output
* **template** - specify a template (see section on Templates for further details)
* **type** - which embedding type to use, this can be `embedplus`, `iframe` or `object`
* **width** - the video width, in pixels

The following parameters will not work with EmbedPlus:

* **autohide** - 0, 1 or 2, this parameter indicates whether the video controls will automatically hide after a video begins playing. The default behaviour, a value of 2, is for the video progress bar to fade out while the player controls (play button, volume control, etc.) remain visible. If this parameter is set to 0, the video progress bar and the video player controls will be visible throughout the video. If this parameter is set to 1, then the video progress bar and the player controls will slide out of view a couple of seconds after the video starts playing. They will only reappear if the user moves her mouse over the video player or presses a key on her keyboard.
* **controls** - yes or no, should the controls be shown?
* **loop** - yes or no, whether to start the video again once it ends

The following parameters will not work with EmbedPlus or if IFRAME uses HTML5:

* **annotation** - yes or no, this determines if annotations are shown
* **cc** - yes or no, decided whether closed captions (subtitles) are displayed
* **disablekb** - yes or no, disable keyboard controls
* **fullscreen** - yes or no, this will add the fullscreen button to the toolbar. This also works with EmbedPlus.
* **info** - yes or no, show video information
* **link** - yes or no, link video to YouTube
* **related** - yes or no, show related videos

The following parameters are only for use with EmbedPlus:

* **hd** - play the video in HD quality, if available
* **react** - yes or no, this specified whether you wish to show the Real-time Reactions button
* **stop** - this stops the video at a specific time, given in seconds
* **sweetspot** - yes or no, this will find sweet spots for the next/prev buttons

== Alternative Shortcodes ==

Within administration, selecting `Options` from the `YouTube` menu will provide a list of general options. One section is named `Alternative Shortcodes` and allows you to specify 1 or 2 additional shortcodes - these will work exactly the same as the standard shortcode of `[youtube]`.

There are 2 reasons why you might want to do this...

1. If migrating from another plugin, it may use a different shortcode - more details can be found in the section named "Migration"
2. If another plugin uses the same shortcode (e.g. Jetpack) this will allow you to specify and use an alternative

Each of the new shortcodes can also have their own default profile assigned to them (see the Profiles section for more details on this).

== Function Call ==

As well as a shortcode you can also use a PHP function call to display a video (e.g. in a sidebar). The function is named `youtube_video_embed` and has 2 parameters - the first is the video ID (or URL) and the second is a list of display parameters. The display parameters are the same as those used in the shortcode but are separated by an ampersand.

e.g. `youtube_video_embed( 'Z_sCoHGIpU0', 'width=300&height=200' )`

== Widgets ==

Sidebar widgets can be easily added. In Administration simply click on the `Widgets` option under the `Appearance` menu. `YouTube Embed` will be one of the listed widgets. Drag it to the appropriate sidebar on the right hand side and then choose your video options - any that aren't specified are taken from your default profile.

And that's it! You can use unlimited widgets, so you can add different videos to different sidebars.

== Playlists ==

YouTube allows users to create their own playlists - collections of videos that can be played in sequence.

Before version 2 of Artiss YouTube Embed, separate shortcodes and function calls had to be used to specify these. However, now you can simply specify their ID or URL with the standard methods.

e.g. `[youtube]095393D5B42B2266[/youtube]`

Playlists cannot be used along with the EmbedPlus embedding method.

A better alternative to playlists is the build-in lists function in Artiss YouTube Embed - see the Lists section for further details.

== Templates ==

Both in the profile and as a parameter you can specify a template. This allows you to define any CSS that you wish to "wrap" around the YouTube output.

The template consists simply of any HTML that you wish but with `%video%` where you wish the video to appear.

e.g. `<div align="center">%video%</div>`

== Profiles ==

You've probably already had a look at the default profile, accessible by selecting `Profiles` from the `YouTube` administration menu option. Here you can specify the default option which will apply to any embedded video.

However, in the top right hand corner is a drop-down box and a button marked `Change profile`. Simply select an alternative profile and click the button and you can then edit the options for this alternative profile. You can even name it as well.

To use this profile, simply use the parameter `profile=` followed by the profile name or number. The options for this profile will then be used.

This could be useful, for instance, for having a separate profile for different parts of your site - posts, sidebar, etc - or for different video types (e.g. widescreen).

By default you have 5 extra profiles - if you wish to have more (or less) this number can be changed from the `Options` sub-menu.

== Lists ==

Although this plugin will play standard YouTube playlists their playback options are limited. Instead you can create your own video lists. Under the `YouTube` administration menu is a sub-menu named `Lists`. Select this and you will be shown a screen where you can type in a list of video IDs (or URLS). You can also provide a name for the list.

When saving the list each video is validated.

As with profiles you can select the list from a drop down in the top right-hand corner. You can also change the number of lists from the `Options` sub-menu too.

To use a list, simply specify the list name or number instead of a video ID.

e.g. `[youtube]List 1[/youtube]`

There is also a parameter, named `list`, that lets you modify the playback of the list. You can either play each in turn, play them randomly, or have just one played (but picked randomly).

== Transcripts ==

Some YouTube videos include transcripts - this is a text output of the speech from the video with timings added. These are available in XML format and can, via a function call or shortcode, be displayed in your post.

The shortcode `transcript` will display the transcript in your post along with the start time for each line. Simply supply the video ID as a parameter. 

e.g. `[transcript]MSPsrhCPt-0[/transcript]`

If no transcript exists, nothing will be output.

For style purposes, the `SPAN` around the time has a class of `TranscriptTime`, the `SPAN` around the text has a class of `TranscriptText` and the `DIV` around the whole transcript output has a class of `Transcript`.

If you wish to use a PHP function call to get the transcript, then you would use the format `get_youtube_transcript( ID )`, where ID is the video ID.

In all of these cases, the original XML format has been changed to a readable output. If, though, you'd like to return the original XML format, then you can use the call `get_youtube_transcript_xml( ID )`.

== Migration ==

Within administration, selecting `Options` from the `YouTube` menu will provide a list of general options. One section is named `Migration`. There are 2 boxes that can be ticked to activate 2 different types of alternative embedding - these have been provided to allow easy migration from other similar plugins. You can also assign a specific profile to these migrated options.

The first option, `Bracket Embedding`, allows YouTube IDs to be assigned within brackets - similar to shortcodes but without the actual shortcode name. e.g. `[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_sCoHGIpU0]`.

The second option, `Alternative Embedding`, activates a short of other alternative embedding methods.

In both cases, activating these will impact performance so should only be used if absolutely necessary.

[Read more details](http://www.artiss.co.uk/artiss-youtube-embed/compatibility "Artiss YouTube Embed Compatibility") on which options to select for which plugin.

== Further options ==

**Thumbnails**

Artiss YouTube embed also has the ability to return a thumbnail of a video (sorry, this doesn't work with playlists). There are two methods you can use for this - a shortcode or a function call.

Use the function call `youtube_thumb_embed( 'id', 'paras', '', 'alt' )` to add a thumbnail to any part of your theme.

Like the video embed equivalent, the ID is the video ID and alt is the alternative text for the thumbnail image (optional). The parameters are different, however, but, again, are separated by ampersand.

The parameters are as follows...

* **rel** - specify a REL override, e.g. rel="nofollow"
* **target** - specify a TARGET override, e.g. target="_blank"
* **width** - this specifies the width of the thumbnail image
* **height** - this specifies the height of the thumbnail image

e.g. `youtube_thumb_embed( 'id', 'rel=nofollow&target=_blank', '', 'Demo Video' )`

To use the shortcode method, insert `[youtube_thumb]id[/youtube_thumb]` into a post or page to create a thumbnail of the relevant video ID which, once clicked, will open up the appropriate YouTube page.

Like the function call above, you can specify a number of parameters. They are the same as detailed above but with the addition of one further parameter...

* **alt** - specify some `ALT` text for the thumbnail image

e.g. `[youtube_thumb target="_blank" alt="Demo video"]id[/youtube_thumb]`

This overrides the `TARGET` and `ALT` elements of the thumbnail.

**Video name**

You can retrieve the name of a video via 1 of 2 methods.

You can call the PHP function `get_youtube_name`, passing it to the video URL or ID - this will return the name of the video.

e.g. `echo get_youtube_name( 'Z_sCoHGIpU0' );`

Alternatively, you can use the shortcode `[youtube_name]`, again passing the video URL or ID. The video name will be displayed.

e.g. `[youtube_name]Z_sCoHGIpU0[/youtube_name]`

**Shortened URL**

You may return a short URL for any YouTube video by way of either a function call or a shortcode.

For a function call add `youtube_short_url( 'id' )` to your code to return a URL (note that this is not written out, but returned as a value), where `id` is the video ID.

e.g. `<a href="<?php echo youtube_short_url( 'Z_sCoHGIpU0' ); ?>"Click here for video</a>`

This will create a link to a video using the short URL standard.

To use the shortcode method simply insert `[youtube_url id=xx]` anywhere within a post to return a shortened URL. `xx` is the ID of the video.

**Download URL**

If you wish your users to be able to download a YouTube video or playlist then you can do this via either a shortcode of PHP function call.

The function call is named `get_video_download` and has one parameter - the video ID. It will return the download link URL.

e.g. `<a href="<?php echo get_video_download( 'Z_sCoHGIpU0' ); ?>">Download the video</a>`

Alternatively, you can use the shortcode `download_video`. The content to link is specified between the open and close shortcode tags and there are 3 parameters...

* **id** - The ID of the video or playlist. This is required.
* **target** - The target of the link (e.g. `_blank`). This is optional.
* **nofollow** - yes or no, use this to specify whether a `nofollow` tag should be added to the link. This is optional and by default it will be included.

e.g. `[download_video id="Z_sCoHGIpU0" target="_blank"]Download the video[/download_video]`

**Caching**

Caches are used to improve plugin performance. Under the `YouTube` administration menu is a sub-menu named `Options`. Select this and find the section named `Performance`. From here there are 3 cache options...

1. Embed Cache - this is how long to store the resulting cache code. It will update if you change any parameters so, theoretically, shouldn't need to change. It defaults to 24 hours.
2. Video Information Cache - video IDs are checked with YouTube to ensure that they're valid. This option lets you to specify how often this should be checked. This defaults to 1 hour.
3. Transcript Cache - how long to store transcripts. Defaults to 24 hours.

In all cases putting the cache to 0 will switch off caching for that option.

**Further Embedding Options**

Under the `YouTube` administration menu is a sub-menu named `Options`. Select this and find the section named `Embedding`. There are 4 options here...

1. Add Metadata - by default, RDFa metadata is added to video output. This can be switched on or off as required (see the FAQs for more information about metadata usage).
2. URL Embedding - if you place a YouTube URL directly into a post then WordPress will convert this to a video. This, however, is not performed by Artiss YouTube Embed. Select this option to allow this plugin to take over this functionality.
3. Comment Embedding - tick this to allow YouTube URLs added to comments to be converted to embedded videos.
4. Feed - videos will not appear in feeds so use this option to decide whether you want them to be converted to links and/or thumbnails.

In the case of URL and Comment embedding a profile can be selected.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `youtube-embed` folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. That's it, you're done - you just need to add the shortcode wherever you need.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I find the ID of a YouTube video? =

If you play a YouTube video, look at the URL - it will probably look something like this - `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y4qzc_JTg`.

The video ID is the list of letters and numbers after `v=`, in this case `L5Y4qzc_JTg`.

= Why can't I change the player colour as I used to? =

Artiss YouTube Embed is now using the latest version of the YouTube Player, named AS3. This does not allow for the player colour to be modified, and a few other options are now missing as well.

Equally, some options are not supported depending on whether you use the IFRAME or OBJECT embedding method.

[Read more about which options are supported](http://www.artiss.co.uk/artiss-youtube-embed/further-help#ye-api "API Support").

= How do I add a border to the video =

The border option is no longer available with the YouTube player. However, you can use the `style` option to mimic it. Simply add a style of `border: 10px solid #b1b1b1`.

= I've upgraded from an earlier version of Artiss YouTube Embed and one of the functions / shortcodes / parameters that I used is no longer documented =

Code created for previous versions of the plugin should still work - however, the functions will not be documented to deter people from using them in the future.

= Is the generated code standards compliant? =

In all cases, yes. However, it depends on which options you choose as to which DOCTYPE it will validate to.

IFRAME does not work with XHTML so will only validate as XHTML transitional (this includes if you use IFRAME as the fallback to EmbedPlus).

If you include Metadata then you must use the XHTML Strict + RDFa DOCTYPE - in this case it validates.

If you don't include Metadata then it will also validate as HTML5 compliant.

The [W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/ "W3C Markup Validation Service") was used to test the above.

You can [read more about this here](http://www.artiss.co.uk/artiss-youtube-embed/further-help#ye-standards "Standards Compliance").

= Which browsers does the output work on? =

It uses standard OBJECT and IFRAME coding - this, along with the above standards compliance, means that the output should work on most browsers.

However, I can confirm that it's been tested in IE7 (IE8 in compatibility mode), IE8, IE9, Firefox 5 and Chrome 12.

= Which version of PHP does this plugin work with? =

It has been syntax checked as PHP 4. However, this does not guarantee PHP 4 compatibility and the minimum for WordPress is now PHP 5.2.4.

Although I attempt to keep with PHP 4 compatability there are no guarantees of this.

= A new box has appeared on my dashboard all about Artiss plugins =

That's correct - all Artiss plugins will now add this feature to keep you up-to-date with the latest plugin news and support links. If you wish to switch it off simply click on the "Screen Options" tab at the top and untick "Artiss Plugin News & Support".
